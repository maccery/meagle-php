## Installation
### Requirements
- PHP >= 5.6.4
- OpenSSL PHP Extension
- PDO PHP Extension
- Mbstring PHP Extension
- Tokenizer PHP Extension
- XML PHP Extension
- Composer
- NPM

### 1) Dependencies
```sh
composer install
npm install
```

Then, for production:
```
npm start
```

Or, for development:
```
npm run-script dev
```
### 2) Database
You'll need a MySQL database for the application to work.

### 3) Environmental variables
You'll then need to update the environment variables in the  ``/.env`` that should have been created.
```
DB_CONNECTION=
DB_HOST=
DB_PORT=
DB_DATABASE=
DB_USERNAME=
DB_PASSWORD=
```


### 4) Then run the migrations:
```
php artisan migrate
```

### 5) You're ready!

## Builds
When building the application, you just need to run these commands:
```
composer install
npm start
php artisan migrate
phpunit
```

This will install all dependencies, run the database migrations and run the unit tests. 

## Deploying
When deploying, simply release the build on a server with the given requirements above. Environment variables need to be set and a database ready. The `document_root` is the `public` folder.
