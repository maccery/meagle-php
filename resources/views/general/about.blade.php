            <p>Meagle is a site where you can find reviews about any piece of software, or write a review about a piece
                of software.</p>

            <p>Reviews are voted on by other users and are then sorted by votes: the more votes a review has, the higher
                it is.</p>

            <p>The more important a user is, the more their vote counts for: this makes it easy for top users to have
                their reviews near the top.</p>

            <p><b>Meagle is open-source and is completely impartial.</b></p>
